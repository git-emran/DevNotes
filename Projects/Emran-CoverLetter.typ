I am a Software Engineer and a Product Designer. I bring over eight years of experience working across front end engineering, product design, and system architecture, with a strong focus on building scalable, accessible, and high performing digital products.

In my current role as Product Lead and Software Engineer at Tiblo Digital, I have led the design and launch of more than *25* Production Ready Products for clients across Europe. One of my key contributions was leading the development of WheelLog, an innovative collaboration product built with React and real time presence using *CRDT* based synchronization. The product achieved an *80%* customer conversion rate in its first quarter. Alongside delivery, I introduced structured design systems, Storybook driven documentation, and Figma workflows that reduced design debt and improved cross functional alignment.

Previously at The Total Office, I worked as a Front end Engineer with a strong UX focus on a high traffic e commerce platform. I led security remediation efforts that reduced known *CVEs* from over 400 to a single digit. I also implemented accessibility improvements using *ARIA* standards and keyboard navigation, achieving near full WCAG compliance and measurable satisfaction improvements for users with diverse abilities. Performance optimization was another major focus, where improvements to Core Web Vitals reduced load times from *3.4 seconds to 1.2 seconds* and increased conversion rates by *20 %*.

Earlier in my career, I served as Lead UX and UI Designer at MarketTime, where I helped modernize an enterprise platform by leading the migration from Angular 3 to Angular 10. I designed and shipped a payment system used by the majority of the customer base and introduced a scalable design system that cut future development effort significantly while improving delivery speed and consistency.

My technical skill set includes JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, React, Angular, Svelte, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL, Docker, Linux, and cloud platforms such as Google Cloud. I am comfortable working across the full product lifecycle, from system design and implementation to performance optimization and accessibility compliance.

I am particularly interested in roles where engineering quality, product thinking, and user experience intersect. I value clean architecture, measurable impact, and collaboration with designers, engineers, and stakeholders to solve real problems.
