## ğŸ›’Â **Problem â€” Group Transactions**

### Problem Description

You are given a list of transactions, where each transaction is represented by theÂ **name of an item**Â that was purchased.  
Your task is to count how many times each item appears, then return the list of items and their transaction counts â€” sorted by the following rules:

1. **Descending order of transaction count**Â (most transactions first).
2. If two or more items have the same count, sort them inÂ **alphabetical order (ascending)**Â by item name.

Each output line should show the item name followed by a space and then the transaction count.


### Input Format

- The first line contains an integerÂ **n**Â â€” the number of transactions.
- The nextÂ **n**Â lines each contain a string â€” the name of an item.

Constraints:
- 1â‰¤nâ‰¤1051â‰¤nâ‰¤105
- Each item name consists only of lowercase English letters (`a`â€“`z`)
- The length of each item name â‰¤ 10
### Example

transactions = ['notebook', 'notebook', 'mouse', 'keyboard', 'mouse']
There are two items with 2 transactions each: 'notebook' and 'mouse'. In alphabetical order, they are 'mouse', 'notebook'.
There is one item with 1 transaction: 'keyboard'.
The return array, sorted as required, is ['mouse 2', 'notebook 2', 'keyboard 1'].
### Function Description
Complete the functionÂ **groupTransactions**Â in the editor below.
**groupTransactions**Â has the following parameter(s):
- `string transactions[n]`: eachÂ `transactions[i]`Â denotes the item name in the iáµ—Ê° transaction
**Returns:**
- `string[]`: an array of strings ofÂ `"item name[space]transaction count"`Â sorted as described
### Constraints

`1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 10^5 1 â‰¤ length of transactions[i] â‰¤ 10 transactions[i] contains only lowercase English letters, ascii[a-z]`

### Input Format for Custom Testing

Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function.

The first line contains a single integer,Â **n**, the size of transactions.  
Each of the nextÂ **n**Â lines contains a string, the item name forÂ `transactions[i]`.
### Sample Case 1

**Sample Input**

`4 bin can bin bin`

**Sample Output**

`bin 3 can 1`

**Explanation**

There is one itemÂ `'bin'`Â with 3 transactions.  
There is one itemÂ `'can'`Â with 1 transaction.  
The return array sorted descending by transaction count, then ascending by name isÂ `['bin 3', 'can 1']`.

### Sample Case 2

**Sample Input**

`3 banana pear apple`

**Sample Output**

`apple 1 banana 1 pear 1`

**Explanation**

There is one itemÂ `'apple'`Â with 1 transaction.  
There is one itemÂ `'banana'`Â with 1 transaction.  
There is one itemÂ `'pear'`Â with 1 transaction.  
The return array sorted descending by transaction count, then ascending by name isÂ `['apple 1', 'banana 1', 'pear 1']`.`


## ğŸ’»Â **Problem 2 â€” Application Log Analysis**

### Problem Description

You are given an unordered list of log entries from an application.  
Each log entry has the format:

`"user_id timestamp action"`
- **user_id**: A numeric string (no leading zeros).
- **timestamp**: The time in seconds since the app was launched.
- **action**: EitherÂ `"sign-in"`Â orÂ `"sign-out"`.
Your task is to find all users whoÂ **signed out within**Â `maxSpan`Â seconds of signing in.

You must return (and print) the list of such user IDs, sorted inÂ **ascending numeric order**.

### Input Format

- The first line contains an integerÂ **n**Â â€” the number of log entries.
- The nextÂ **n**Â lines each contain one log entry in the formatÂ `"user_id timestamp action"`.
- The last line contains an integerÂ **maxSpan**.

Constraints:
- 1â‰¤nâ‰¤1051â‰¤nâ‰¤105
- 1â‰¤maxSpanâ‰¤1091â‰¤maxSpanâ‰¤109
- Each user:
    - Signs inÂ **at most once**
    - Signs outÂ **at most once**
    - HasÂ `sign-in timestamp < sign-out timestamp`
- Logs may appear inÂ **any order**.
- The result will contain at least one user.

### Output Format

Print each user ID (as a string) that signed out withinÂ `maxSpan`Â seconds of signing in, in ascending numeric order â€” one per line.

### Example 1

**Input**

`6 99 1 sign-in 100 10 sign-in 50 20 sign-in 100 15 sign-out 50 26 sign-out 99 2 sign-out 5`

**Output**

`99 100`
### Example 2

**Input**

`4 60 12 sign-in 80 20 sign-out 10 20 sign-in 60 20 sign-out 100`

**Output**

`60`
