### About the role

One of the RubyLabs’ portfolio companies is looking for a Mid UI/UX Engineer to join our team and take full ownership of designing and implementing user interfaces using pre-built component libraries.

This role is perfect for a frontend engineer who enjoys working within structured design systems and ensuring high-quality, data-driven user experiences. You will be responsible for both defining the UI structure (using existing components) and implementing it in code—without relying on a separate designer.

If you thrive in a results-driven environment, value autonomy, and enjoy building intuitive, scalable UI without subjective design guesswork, this is the role for you
