     **`CONCEPT:`** _**Design Backwards**, Referring to Airbnb‚Äôs ‚Äú**what if**‚Äù technique, and one user-story at a time technique to scale a product and ensure product led growth._


- **Can you walk me through your design process? (Always include examples)**
  I am a firm believer of the `Atomic Design Process` - Where we create `atoms`, `molecules`, `organisms`, `Templates`, `pages` - Making sure the design is Scalable, technically feasible and efficient
  I am also a firm believer of the double diamond approach. Which is very similar to the Agile approach of product development. That is to Discover, Define, Design, Deliver.
  *I try to use these informations to help identify challenges consumers face so I can ideate how to solve them.*


- **How do you test your Product design ?**
  üí° **A-**¬† My fundamental goal always stays the same and that is to empathize with the users and build a solution around it. Early stage SWOT analysis is very important part in a Product Journey. I also do Attitudinal and Behavioral testing - noticing ‚Äúwhat people say vs what people do‚Äù. I also do Heuristic Evaluation. Using A certain list of best practices according to industry standards and identify where the product is not following those principles. Here are some examples of crucial OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) for product design:
  **`Improve User Experience`**
  - Key Result 1: Increase user satisfaction scores by 10% through usability testing and iterative design improvements.

  - Key Result 3: Improve cross-functional collaboration by establishing clear communication channels, resulting in a 15% reduction in delays.
    **`Using tools like HotJar, UserZoom, Maze`**
	
	
- **_When someone says, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like this design,‚Äù what do you do?_**
  - Disagreements are natural in design iteration.
  - Recently faced disagreements over product customization for a valued client.
  - Focus on understanding project goals and user needs.
  - Went back to refine solutions, considering feedback.
  - Prioritized effectiveness in achieving objectives.
  - Collaborated with the client to find mutually satisfactory solutions.
  - Stayed open to feedback and presented alternatives when needed.
  

- **What are some of the biggest challenges you face as a product designer?**
  For me varies from sprint to sprint and quarterly each year. But last year at the total office my biggest challenge was market visibility and customer acquisition while we tackled that pretty smoothly, this year we are taking up the challenge of doubling our customer satisfaction rate. Data suggests it can boost our performance in the market by 5 0%

---

- **How do you collaborate with a cross-functional team ?**
  IF Synchronous -
  - Utilize existing meetings to **discuss roadblocks** and **backlogs** (usually happens in stand-ups).
  - If detailed design discussions are needed, **I include Engineers, Marketing Dept. early** on to **calculate technical feasibility.**

  IF Asynchronous and something went wrong -
  - I usually have a format - Discuss the issue ‚Üí Share the current understanding (to be on the same page) ‚Üí What I think went wrong ‚Üí Possible solutions.

- **Walk me through a product design example where you set out to solve a business problem.**
  - Talking about the discovery/problem definition phase, where we carried out comprehensive research to uncover insights into the source of the problem.
  - Next, keeping business goals in mind, we would research users from the target demographic and identify common themes, unmet user needs, and where the business may have fallen short in serving that demographic. Then demonstrate my skill at evaluating the goals of the company, the use case scenarios, and how to best align them to find a solution.
  - Lastly, I would reach into my product design toolkit and use wireframes and prototypes (among other things) to explore potential product design solutions. Through user testing, I validate ideas and hypotheses focused on obtaining significant business value from the solutions achieved by optimal product design.

  For Example : While Designing The Content Generator AI, the initial idea from the stakeholders was that they were not gonna include content customization on an early stage, this decision was made from directly observing the competitions. But I after I joined the team, my research findings were different from what they expected. We surveyed 100 content writers and found out that 91% of the writers would love to have some type of customization. So I fought for it, my idea was implemented in the MVP and after the launch it was an instant hit on the Wordpress blog writers community.
  I was set out to solve a critical business problem (trying to save money on each session an API is called)

- **Describe your most challenging Project ?**
  Get Genie AI, This product had the worst deadline and almost zero budget to go with. There were only 4 team members and the product had no roadmap or customer base. So we had to improvise through out the launch.
  - We did competitor analysis and discovered potential features that can be turned into USP‚Äôs (Unique selling points)
  - First iteration was a disaster, navigation and
  - Features were designed by testing internally (my wife, my brother, my mom etc..)
  - We held back on certain features for v2 release because no time to do unit tests, stress tests etc.
  - Released the product and itrerated on the live production code to handle deadline.

- **Describe a situation where you have taken the lead in creating the direction and strategy within a new or ambiguous space. What steps did you take to establish clarity and define the path forward? How did your leadership contribute to the success of the project or initiative?**
  - During routine usability testing of B2B dashboard, discovered opportunity from user feedback
  - User comment: "wait let me check my google analytics" sparked idea for integrated analytics
  - Developed proposal and pitched to stakeholders
  - Launched beta version to test market response
  - Feature became highly demanded as competitors lacked similar functionality
  - Overcame API cost challenges by developing in-house solutions
  - Collaborated with engineering team to create custom API services
  - Validated assumptions through user testing
  - Successfully launched mtView with 89% adoption rate

- **Tell me About a time when you disagreed with a Stakeholder/Senior Developer/Manager ?**
  üí° **A-** **Developer Point of View:** _Trying to understand where the opposition is coming from. Asking a lot of clarifying questions, trying to understand if it is a technical constraint, or is it based off of history that I am not aware of or just a personal preference. Asking specific questions on the why ? and finding out the root of the disagreement also helps me deeply understand how the developer is thinking and what it takes to develop the design. Because as a designer I can tend to over inflate what I think as an ideal proposal but a developer can help bring me back on earth. This is all about getting in the mind of the individual and collaborating in a transparent manner. I also acknowledge the fact that I have some sort of accountability for the health of the experience and defend the decisions I make for the users thats why presenting all the reasoning behind design decisions is a cruicial aspect of this conversation_
- **What does it mean to be a great product designer ?**
  A seasoned, experienced product designer balances business goals and technical constraints with creating the best user experience possible, Improving the product one iteration at a time. Also in short I can also say that as a Product designer my role is to make sure the customers don‚Äôt Push on the Pull door.
- **Tell me about your strengths ?**
  My core strengths as a Product designer includes my `ability to find clarity through ambiguity` , navigate and scale any idea even if its just a single sentence.
- **What is your favorite product ?**
  It is a product That is use daily. And that is Twitter now named X. My favorite part of twitter experience is their community notes and twitter space. To me Community notes is one of the most efficient way to put correct information out there. And about twitter space, I love how twitter gave us the flexibility to start an audio conversation at anytime anywhere. This is literally the definition of giving the power back to the users.
