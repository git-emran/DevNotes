# 📌 50 Senior Web Developer Interview Questions & Answers

---

## 🟢 **Core JavaScript & Frontend (10)**

**1. What are the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in JavaScript?**

- `var`: Function-scoped, hoisted, allows re-declaration. Can cause bugs.
- `let`: Block-scoped, hoisted but not initialized until runtime, can be reassigned but not redeclared.
- `const`: Block-scoped, must be initialized, cannot be reassigned.  
   👉 Best practice: Use `const` by default, `let` when you need reassignment, avoid `var`.

**2. Can you explain event delegation in JavaScript?**  
Event delegation is when you attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of each child. The event “bubbles up” through the DOM, and the handler can check the target.  
✅ Example: Instead of attaching click handlers to 100 buttons, attach one handler to the parent and detect clicks.  
👉 Benefits: Better performance, memory efficient, works with dynamically added elements.

**3. How does the JavaScript event loop work?**

- **Call Stack**: Executes synchronous code.
- **Task Queue (Callback Queue)**: Stores async callbacks (`setTimeout`, DOM events).
- **Microtask Queue**: Stores promises & mutation observers. Runs before task queue.  
   👉 Order: Stack → Microtasks → Tasks → Render.  
   This ensures promises resolve before regular callbacks.

**4. Difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**

- **Synchronous**: Blocks execution until finished. (e.g., `for loop`, `alert`)
- **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking, allows execution to continue (`setTimeout`, `fetch`, promises).  
   👉 Async improves performance and UX by avoiding freezes.

**5. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**

- `==`: Loose equality, performs type coercion. (`"5" == 5 → true`).
- `===`: Strict equality, checks both type and value. (`"5" === 5 → false`).  
   👉 Best practice: Always use `===` unless you explicitly want coercion.

**6. How does React’s Virtual DOM improve performance?**

- React creates a lightweight Virtual DOM copy of the UI.
- On state change, React diffs the old vs. new Virtual DOM (reconciliation).
- Only updates changed nodes in the real DOM.  
   👉 Benefit: Faster rendering since direct DOM manipulation is costly.

**7. What are React hooks, and why are they important?**  
Hooks let you use state and lifecycle features in functional components.

- `useState`: local state
- `useEffect`: lifecycle (componentDidMount, etc.)
- `useMemo`, `useCallback`: performance optimizations  
   👉 Hooks simplify code, avoid class components, and promote reusability.

**8. How do you optimize React app performance?**

- Use `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Use `useMemo` / `useCallback` for expensive operations.
- Code splitting with dynamic imports.
- Virtualize long lists (`react-window`).
- Avoid inline functions in render.

**9. Difference between REST and GraphQL?**

- **REST**: Multiple endpoints, over-fetching/under-fetching issues.
- **GraphQL**: Single endpoint, client defines shape of data, no over-fetching.  
   👉 Use REST for simple APIs, GraphQL for complex, data-heavy UIs.

**10. Explain CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).**  
CORS is a security feature in browsers that restricts requests between different origins.

- Without CORS headers, cross-domain requests fail.
- Server must set headers like:
  `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com`

👉 Prevents malicious sites from accessing private APIs.

---

## 🟡 **Back-End & Databases (10)**

**11. What is the difference between monolithic and microservices architecture?**

- **Monolithic**: Single codebase, easier to start, harder to scale.
- **Microservices**: Independent services communicating via APIs, easier to scale, harder to manage.  
   👉 Senior developers often recommend microservices for large teams and scaling needs.

---

**12. How does Node.js handle concurrency with a single thread?**  
Node.js uses an **event-driven non-blocking I/O model**.

- Single-threaded event loop.
- Offloads heavy tasks to worker threads/libuv.  
   👉 Enables handling thousands of concurrent connections efficiently.

---

**13. Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases?**

- **SQL (Relational)**: Structured schema, ACID transactions, good for financial apps. (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **NoSQL (Non-relational)**: Flexible schema, horizontal scaling, great for unstructured data. (MongoDB, DynamoDB)  
   👉 Choice depends on data structure & scaling needs.

---

**14. Explain database indexing. Why is it important?**  
Indexes are special lookup tables that speed up queries.

- Without index → Full table scan (slow).
- With index → Quick lookup (fast).  
   👉 Tradeoff: Indexes speed reads but slow writes & use extra storage.

---

**15. What is an ORM, and do you recommend using one?**  
ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) allows querying the database using objects instead of SQL.

- Pros: Faster dev, less boilerplate, DB-agnostic.
- Cons: Performance overhead, complex queries harder.  
   👉 Use ORM for standard apps, raw SQL for high-performance queries.

---

**16. Explain JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.**

- JWTs are encoded tokens containing user data and signatures.
- Stored on client-side (localStorage/cookies).
- Sent with each request to validate identity.  
   👉 Advantage: Stateless, scalable.  
   👉 Risk: Token theft → always use HTTPS & short expiry.

---

**17. Difference between session-based and token-based authentication?**

- **Session-based**: Server stores session in DB, client gets a cookie. Not scalable for large apps.
- **Token-based (JWT)**: Server issues a signed token, client stores it, server only validates signature. More scalable.

---

**18. How do you prevent SQL injection?**

- Always use parameterized queries (`?` placeholders).
- Never concatenate user input into SQL strings.
- Use ORM safeguards.  
   👉 Example (Node + MySQL):

`db.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", [userId])`

---

**19. Explain CAP theorem in distributed databases.**  
CAP = Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance.

- Can only guarantee **2 out of 3**.
- **CP**: Strong consistency but may sacrifice availability (e.g., MongoDB with replica sets).
- **AP**: Always available but eventual consistency (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra).

---

**20. How do you scale a web application?**

- Vertical scaling (bigger servers).
- Horizontal scaling (more servers + load balancing).
- Use caching (Redis, CDN).
- DB replication & sharding.
- Asynchronous processing (queues like RabbitMQ, Kafka).
