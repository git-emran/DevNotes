# Task 1: Reproduce a Wix/GoDaddy-like design

Pick a template from Wix or GoDaddy (say, a car detailing website) and recreate it in static HTML/CSS.

> Donâ€™t copy pixel-for-pixel â†’ use it as inspiration, but replace the content with Zarlaâ€™s AI-generated sample content.

### _Focus on just one page (homepage) with key sections like:_

- Hero

- Services

- Why Choose Us

- Testimonials, etc.

---

> Show iterations: e.g. a rough layout first, then improved typography/colors, then polished design.

> Deploy a live preview (GH Pages, to Vercel, Netlify, etc.) and share the code (GitHub).

At the end, summarize whatâ€™s missing for it to be production-ready (e.g. responsiveness, accessibility, SEO polish, animations, etc.).

- Design eye.

- Your ability to translate inspiration â†’ high-quality code.
